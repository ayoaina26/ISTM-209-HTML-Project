                        Texas A&M University's "The Big Event" is a monumental one-day student-run service project. It
                        started as a way to thank
                        Bryan and College Station locals for their unwavering support of the university and its
                        students. Joe Nussbaum
                        envisioned a time when students would work together, united in purpose, to complete a variety of
                        community service
                        projects. These projects, ranging from revitalizing neighborhood parks to assisting elderly
                        residents with home repairs,
                        frequently include yard work, painting, and other types of essential home maintenance, directly
                        impacting the lives of
                        homeowners who may need a helping hand.
                        <br><br>
                        Most of the participants in the event are Texas A&M students who give their time and energy to
                        help the community. The
                        Big Event embodies the fundamental principles of the Aggie Spirit through a strong sense of
                        camaraderie and service. It
                        is founded on a shared desire to express gratitude to the community that so generously supports
                        Texas A&M. Annually,
                        thousands of students participate in the event, making it one of the biggest student-run
                        volunteer initiatives in the
                        country.
